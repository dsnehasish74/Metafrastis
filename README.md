# PROBLEM OUR PROJECT SOLVES
With the onset of Covid-19 we have been confined to the boundaries of our homes. Communication today is accomplished majorly over online conference where sound quality is often poor. . Holding Google translator in one hand and phone in the other is simply not a feasible enough solution. For example in one instance, a Bengali phrase "Kemon achen?" (How are you?) got translated to "You are a thief" in English during an online meeting. Add to that the ever lasting problems like poor sound quality, breaking of sound, etc. 

So we decided to capture the speech of the person from his/her side and then use Google Translate to translate the captured text. This eliminates the possibility of wrong translation due poor sound, network error, etc that may occur if Google translate is to be used on the other side of the call.

- We thought of creating a website that captures your speech and converts it to a text in the preferred language of the person on other side.
- The text will be displayed in native language of the user. He will also have the option of listening to the speech in his native language.
- At the same time, people with hearing impairment will be able to visualize the words in front of him. Although this feature is already available in Google Meet, combining translator and speech recognition is what makes this site unique.
