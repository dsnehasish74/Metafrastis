# PROBLEM OUR PROJECT SOLVES
With the onset of Covid-19 we have been confined to the boundaries of our homes. Communication today is accomplished majorly over online conference where sound quality is often poor. And in case people do not understand one another's language, then even quality of soung becomes a secondary factor.
- So we thought of creating a website that captures your speech and converts it to a text in the preferred language of the person on other side.
- The text will be displayed in native language of the user. He will also have the option of listening to the speech in his native language.
- At the same time, people with hearing impairment will be able to visualize the words in front of him. Although this feature is already available in Google Meet, combining translator and speech recognition is what makes this site unique.
